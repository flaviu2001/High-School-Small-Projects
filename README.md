# Personal small projects
A collection of all of my source codes from high school which are solutions to various problems on sites like infoarena.ro codeforces.com and others.

You will find the algorithmics solutions in the ONI (National Olympiad in Informatics) folder, those are all the source codes of problems i solved to train myself for competitions. All 692 c++ files were written by me over the span of 4 years.

In the Algorithms folder you'll find a few implementations of well known techniques and data structures which i wrote to help figure out later in case i forget them.

Java, Python and Webdev are folders which contain projects i did in highschool to learn different languages as i only used up until that point c++, i have reddit bots, a simple login page and a sudoku solver in Java for example.
